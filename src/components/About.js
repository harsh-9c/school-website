            It is a pleasure and sorrows, that they should not be elected in
            some cases we may be able to do. It was from this, or something
            similar because it is pleasure, look for the debts. No one of these
            will open the very laborious, all the consequences of things, of
            current events.

                  By far, the most common end of the year award is for
                  attendance. Students can be rewarded for each quarter,
                  semester, or for the entire Blue Ribbon from Dreamstime school
                  year. This is a popular reward mainly because everyone is in
                  with a chance of winning. Students do not need to have
                  excelled in any kind of academic achievement; they just need
                  to have attended school. Academic achievements are important
                  to recognize. After all, students attend school primarily to
                  learn new skills. Recognizing the achievements that they have
                  made in each area with curricular awards is a great way to
                  foster confidence and promote good study habits. The following
                  are examples of popular end of year awards that are often used
                  by elementary school teachers.
